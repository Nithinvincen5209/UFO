## 🚀 About This Project

UFO Lander is a challenging game. The primary goal is to master Unity's physics engine (Rigidbody) to create a satisfying and responsive feel for the ship.

The player must fight against gravity. Landing too fast, at the wrong angle will cause the ship to crash. This project demonstrates my ability to manage physics, handle complex game states (playing, won, lost), and build a complete game loop.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Realistic Physics-Based Controls:** Uses Unity's Rigidbody to simulate gravity, thrust, and rotation.
* **Precise Collision Detection:** The game can tell the difference between a safe landing (correct speed and angle on a flat pad) and a crash.
* **Particle Effects:** Custom particle systems for the main thruster, side thrusters, and explosion on crash.
* **Game State Management:** A clean system for handling game states like "Playing," "Level Complete," and "Crashed."
